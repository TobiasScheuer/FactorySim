# FactorySim

FactorySim is a gamified factory simulation based on the pygame engine.

### ToDo: 
- add more machines
- add more products
- incorporate manual/automatic mode into FactorySim.py
- modularize code more
- Refactor entities to use pygames Sprite mechanics?


### Goal of this Simulation:
Visualize a HMI for a 2-D factory including manufacturing machines, intralogistics, productivity stats.
[3-D factory by having floors, switch floor with arrows on display]
Chose between pre-setup or player-based input for layout
Grid-based system (rectangles are 25x25 pixels) 

Available machines: 
product-adder
storage unit
box_lid-adder

Available intralogistics elements:
conveyor belt
roller , accumulating roller
robot arm
drones?

Available products:
empty box
bottles

++V0.0 add grid and visualize

++V0.1 add first pre-setup machine, first belt

++V0.1.1 define interfaces and orientation check

++V0.2 add empty box

++V0.3 add animations to machines, movement to products

+V0.4 expand setup

V0.5a switch to player based layout -> FactorySimManual.py
V1.2 decorate HUD
